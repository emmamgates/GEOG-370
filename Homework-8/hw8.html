<h1>Homework 8: Geoprocessing Analysis </h1>
<h2>Emma Gates</h2>
<h3>I asked the question: "What places - that I have lived - get affected by the noise on game days. I have lived in 6 places on campus and I have had many different experiences in each of them.
    I used the average decible output at an average hertz to calculate how far the noise will reach all around. Assuming the noise came from a condensed space in the middle of the stadium I found the noise would travel around 400 Meters from the stadium in every direction.
    For the noise output I used a buffer geopressing tool around the stadium polygon. I then used the Intersect tool to determine which buildings/sections were affected by the noise. If I wanted to only show those affected I would have used the difference tool but I thought It was interesting to see all the buildings.

<h3>My map is accurate becuase I was most affected by football when I lived in Winston and Hardin; the noise made it harder to work on my weekend homework.</h3>
