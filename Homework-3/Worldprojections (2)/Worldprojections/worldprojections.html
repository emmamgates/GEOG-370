    <h1>In this project I learned how to display images in different projections
        By: Emma Gates
    </h1>
    
    <h2 style="color:red">Describe in your own words how you displayed the map in different projections using QGIS</h2>
    <p> After Installing the Indicatrix Mapper and gathering my world data from the Natural Earth data base, I was able to change the projections in QGIS using the CRS project properties. Each different projection I looked up, and applied to the map, distorted in some way the shape, area, size, or distance. I made a different layout project for each projection and made them into PNG's. </p>
    
    <h2>WGS84 Projection</h2>
    <h3>This map projection is the one I am most familiar with. It distorts the distance and area but preserves the shape and size.
        It is the easiest projection to look at to memorize the shapes. 
    </h3>

    <h2>Aitoff Projection</h2>
    <h3>The Aitoff projection seems to be a modified azimuthal projection. It is a projection that takes the form of an ellipse.The only point free of distortion is the center point. Distortion of shape and area are moderate throughout </h3>

    <h2>EPSG 3857 Psuedo Mercador</h2>
    <h3>The Psuedo Mercador map projection allows the indicatrix mapper to have perfectly sized and distributed circles and lines.
        In return, the map area is highly distorted, for example, Greenland is nearly the size of Africa, which is not accurate.

    <h2>ESRI 5430 World Robinson</h2>
    <h3>The World Robinson map projection is one of the more aesthetic projections.It does not eliminate any type of distortion, but it keeps the levels of all types of distortion relatively low over most of the map</h3>

    <h2>ESRI 54034 Cylindrical Equal Area</h2>
    <h3>This is a type of cylindric projection. The meridians are vertical lines that are equally spaced and parallel to each other. The lines of latitude are horizontal straight lines, the same length as the equator, but their spacing gets smaller toward the poles. </h3>

    </a>
    <h2>ESRI 54027 Equidistant Conic</h2>
    <h3> This projection has equally spaced meridians that seem to converge at a single point. It creates a circular map that mildly distorts all the features. </h3>

    </a>
    <h2>ESRI 53022 Sphere Quartic</h2>
    <h3>It seems that Shapes, directions, angles, and distances are generally distorted. Scale is true along the equator and constant along all latitudes.</h3>

    </a>
    <h2>ESRI 53018 Sphere Winkel</h2>
    <h3>This projection is not equal-area. It distorts shapes, areas, distances, directions, and angles. The high latitude areas are exaggerated. There are also Bulging meridians that produce considerable distortion toward the edges of the projection</h3>

    <h2>ESRI 102016 North Pole Azimuthal</h2>
    <h3>This projection greatly distorts the shape and the distortion gets greater the further you get from the central map point. </h3>

    </a>
    <h2>ESR1 53046 Sphere Craster Parabolic</h2>
    <h3>I chose to add this one due to its odd shape and parabolic longitudes. I notice it is similar to the sphere quartic projection! </h3>

    <h2 style="color:red">Done!</u></h2>
    <h3>Notes: My two chosen are the 53046 and 53022</h3>
